# Basic-Image-Classification
A trained neural network model which can predict handwritten images.

This is my first project on Machine learning using keras API in Tensorflow.
A trained neural network is built to classify handwritten digit images.

I have completed this guided project from a coursera course instructed by Amit yadav.
